Hi! Sharan here. I wanted to start diving into how to incorprate AI into my projects and figure out how it works, so I decided to make a straightforward AI Chatbot!
I used Flask, which is a frame work of Python, to create the backend for the project in Python.
For the frontend, I used React, which I was already familiar with from previous work.
I was able to create this AI Chatbot by using Google's free Gemini GenAI API
